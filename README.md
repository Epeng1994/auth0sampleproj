Deliver a working prototype (outside the app in a different repo or in a codesandbox) that creates a login/signup flow in a Create React App Application Auth0 React SDK Quickstarts: Add Login to your React App 

The application should contain a “Secure Route” or some kind of Hook that implements the “isAuthenticated” behavior to check for an authenticated user and route them to login if not.

The application should also be ready to send of an axios Request with an Authheader tacked on. See: axiosWithAuth for some inspiration.
